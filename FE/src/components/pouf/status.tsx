/** A status readout that refuses to overstate its own confidence.
 *
 * Two things this fixes, both of which a bare coloured dot gets wrong:
 *
 * 1. A green dot on a polled UI means "green as of some past moment we aren't
 *    showing you." That can be worse than no indicator: the user reads
 *    "connected" off a value that may be a minute stale, from a poll that has
 *    been failing. So a reading past STALE_AFTER_MS drops to an explicit unknown
 *    state rather than keeping its last colour.
 * 2. WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.1 (Level A) forbids colour as the only carrier of
 *    information. The dot is decorative (aria-hidden) and the text is the
 *    actual signal — so this reads correctly with no colour vision at all.
